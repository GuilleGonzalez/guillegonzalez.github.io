# Guillermo Gonzalez

> &emsp; *I am not my own, but belong - body and soul, in life and in death - to my faithful Savior, Jesus Christ. He has fully paid for all my sins with His precious blood and has delivered me from the tyranny of the devil. He also watches over me in such a way that not a hair can fall from my head without the will of my Father in heaven; in fact, all things must work together for my salvation. Because I belong to him, Christ, by His Holy Spirit, also assures me of eternal life and makes me wholeheartedly willing and ready from now on to live for him.* <nobr>- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidelberg_Catechism" target="_blank">Heidelberg Catechism</a></nobr> <nobr>(A1, Public Domain)</nobr>

&emsp; While most people know me as a computer science and STEM person (*please visit my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/guille-gonzalez/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> for the more academic/professional side of me*), I am also deeply interested in the humanities, especially psychology, sociology, and religion. As the block quote above suggests, I am solidly a Christian with generally Reformed views (though I am constantly exploring). Nevertheless, whether your views align with mine or totally differ, I respect you and recognize your views (you have arrived at your views just as I have mine and everyone else has theirs), even if I do not necessarily agree, promote, or live in accord with them. 

&emsp; I truly believe love, kindness, respect, dignity, and forgiveness can make the world a much better place, as I feel as if religion, politics, cliques, and most of all our own selfishness and pride cause so incredibly much unnecessary ruckus and divide. I think taking a step back and truly trying to understand the world from other people's perspective (by deeply thinking about how they view the world and how they have come to view the world as such) can be a great and powerful tool for building empathy; and, in turn, the empathy can foster love, kindness, and respect to make the world a better place.

&emsp; Anyways, aside from one of my central beliefs, I want to leave most of who I am up to real-life conversations and relationships because I don’t think a few paragraphs, pictures, or videos online can do anyone justice because we are way more than who we are/how we present ourselves online. Nonetheless (despite the irony to what I just said), for quick reference, I will list some of my main public internet accounts below:

- <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/guille-gonzalez/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> - With 2.5k+ followers, I guess I am pretty established (though connections/followers only mean so much).
- <a href="https://leetcode.com/guillegonzalez/" target="_blank">LeetCode</a> - It’s my favorite place to solve coding problems and compete in contests (my rating is up and down around 1600). 
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@guillegonzalez" target="_blank">YouTube</a> - With 150+ Subscribers from 57 Videos, I had a lot of fun making Game Dev Videos in Unity w/ C# &amp; Visual Effects Shorts. 
- <a href="https://guillegonzalez.itch.io/" target="_blank">Games &amp; Simulations</a> - From my time as being a Game Dev, there are still twelve projects up, ranging from kind of fun to ultra boring.
- <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learner/guillegonzalez" target="_blank">Coursera</a> - Their platform is one of my favorite places to take online courses and get certificates (I probably don’t use it enough).
- <a href="https://github.com/GuilleGonzalez" target="_blank">GitHub</a> - Smooth handling is provided for large backups, version control, and/or website publishing (such as this one).
<!-- - <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/guillegonz" target="_blank">Kaggle</a> - After just creating a new account, I am currently working on refreshing and enhancing my data science skills. -->

&ensp; Again, while most of these listed accounts show my interest in computer science and technology, I have a ton of other interests and hobbies that are not listed here. I guess you will just have to get to know me in real life to learn more about them. :) *Because I have referenced this website as a "hub of links" from other places, this web page will continue with just collections of links...*
